This project uses C and C language mixing to complete the implementation of a set of intelligent car navigation algorithms. Including fixed-point parking, speed detection, sound and light alarm, automatic navigation and other algorithms, the specific algorithm implementation and circuit design can be seen in my project report main.pdf

# HardWare Details
To help you better understand the details of the algorithm, we show the main control circuit of the vehicle in the figure below

Corresponding to my handwritten IR detection C code, its soldering module is shown in the figure
