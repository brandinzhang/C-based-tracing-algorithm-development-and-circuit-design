This project uses C and C language mixing to complete the implementation of a set of intelligent car navigation algorithms. Including fixed-point parking, speed detection, sound and light alarm, automatic navigation and other algorithms, the specific algorithm implementation and circuit design can be seen in my project report main.pdf
